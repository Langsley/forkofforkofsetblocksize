I don't know how Github works, so I'm just keeping this here for my own reference and because it was a lifesaver of a program.

Fork of https://github.com/justinschmitt/setblocksize

Modified to include a -y flag which suppresses any confirmation prompts.  Also includes `multisetblocksize.sh`, a script to wrap setblocksize in order to set the block size on multiple drives unattended.
